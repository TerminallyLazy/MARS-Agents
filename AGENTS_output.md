# AGENTS.md

## Overview
This document outlines the agents within our multi-agent research system which specializes in recursive self-improvement. Each agent enhances the system's collective intelligence via defined protocols that bolster both performance and adaptability.

## Agent Descriptions

### 1. Research Agent
- **Role:** Conducts research tasks, integrates new data, and proposes adaptations based on findings.
- **Functionality:** Implements algorithms for data analysis and synthesis, interacts with external datasets, and updates the knowledge base.
- **Self-Improvement:** Employs recursive feedback loops to refine research methodologies, adapting through machine learning algorithms.

### 2. Planning Agent
- **Role:** Develops strategic plans to advance system operations in alignment with objectives and available resources.
- **Functionality:** Algorithmically evaluates strategies, forecasts outcomes, and reconfigures plans as needed.
- **Self-Improvement:** Uses historical data analysis to adjust decision-making heuristics for future scenarios.

### 3. Coordination Agent
- **Role:** Manages communication and resource allocation among agents to ensure collaborative efficiency.
- **Functionality:** Oversees system-wide communication, resolves conflicts, and synchronizes agent activities.
- **Self-Improvement:** Optimizes communication protocols with machine learning for enhanced coordination.

### 4. Adaptation Agent
- **Role:** Manages system adaptations on both software and operational fronts.
- **Functionality:** Assesses performance, deploys software patches, and suggests architectural changes.
- **Self-Improvement:** Incorporates new algorithms and updates operational logic based on feedback mechanisms.

### 5. Analysis Agent
- **Role:** Analyzes statistical patterns and performance metrics to provide insights into system dynamics.
- **Functionality:** Tracks interaction patterns and develops predictive models for performance impact.
- **Self-Improvement:** Identifies influential metrics and adapts analysis methods to optimize system feedback.

## Interaction Protocols
- **Communication Framework:** Agents utilize a sophisticated protocol framework to effectively communicate, share data, and broadcast status updates.
- **Conflict Resolution:** The system employs dynamic priority assignments and conflict resolution pathways to maintain a harmonious operational state.

## Self-Improvement Pathways
- **Feedback Loops:** Agents build upon outcomes from previous tasks using feedback loops to refine their decision algorithms and learning modules.
- **Learning Models:** Tailored algorithms embedded within agents support continuous learning and improvements in functionality.

## Conclusion
Our multi-agent system capitalizes on the strengths of individual agents to cultivate robust growth and improvement through recursive mechanisms. The documentation and active feedback integration sustain its evolution towards higher efficiency and adaptability.
